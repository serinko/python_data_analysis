# Numerical Python

**Some of the things in NumPy:**

* ndarray - an efficient multidimentional array with arithmetic opperations and flexible broadcasting capabilities
* Mathematical functions for fast ops on arrays of data without loops
* Tools for reading/writing array data to disk, working with memory-maped files
* Linear algebra, random number generation and Fourier transform caabilities.
* A C API for connecting NumPy with libraries written in C, C++, or Fortran.

Numpy by itself does not provide modeling or scientific functionality, but it is a foundamental knowledge for pandas etc.

**Points of focus in study NumPy:**

* Fast vectorized array ops for data minging and cleaning, subseting and filtering, transformation etc
* Array algo's like sorting, unique, and set ops
* Efficient descriptive statistics and aggregating/summarizing data
* Data alignment and relational data manipulations for merging and joining heterogenous datasets
* Expressing conditional logic as array expression instead of loops with *if-elif-else* branches
* Group-wise data manipulation (aggregation, transformatiion, function application)
