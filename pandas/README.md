* Pandas are prefered for data processing without `for loop`s
* Pandas adopts significant parts of array based style computing from NumPy.
* Often used in conjunction with NumPy, SciPy, statsmodels and scikit-learn and matplotlib.

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas import Series, DataFrame
```
