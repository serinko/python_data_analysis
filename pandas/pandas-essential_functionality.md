# Essential Functionality

Fundamental mechanics of interacting with the data contained in a Series or DataFrame like *data anaysis* and *manipulation topics* - using pandas.

## Reindexing

`reindex()` is an important method on pandas object with the values rearranged to align the new index.
Calling the method rearragens the data according to the new index:
```python
>>> obj = pd.Series([4.5, 7.2, -5.3, 3.6], index=["d","b","a","c"])
>>> obj
d    4.5
b    7.2
a   -5.3
c    3.6
dtype: float64
>>> obj2 = obj.reindex(["a","b","c","d","e"])
>>> obj2
a   -5.3
b    7.2
c    3.6
d    4.5
e    NaN
dtype: float64
```
`reindex()` method has an option `ffill` which forward-fills the values

```python
>>> obj3 = pd.Series(["blue", "purple", "yellow"], index=[0, 2, 4])
>>> obj3
0      blue
2    purple
4    yellow
dtype: object
>>> obj3.reindex(np.arange(6), method="ffill")
0      blue
1      blue
2    purple
3    purple
4    yellow
5    yellow
dtype: object
```
With DataFrame, `reindex` can alter the (row) index, columns, or both. When passed only a sequence, it reindexes the rows in the result:

```python
>>> frame = pd.DataFrame(np.arange(9).reshape((3, 3)),
...     index=["a", "c", "d"],
...     columns=["Ohio", "Texas", "California"])
>>> frame
   Ohio  Texas  California
a     0      1           2
c     3      4           5
d     6      7           8
>>> 
>>> frame2 = frame.reindex(index=["a","b","c","d"])
>>> frame2
   Ohio  Texas  California
a   0.0    1.0         2.0
b   NaN    NaN         NaN
c   3.0    4.0         5.0
d   6.0    7.0         8.0
```
`columns` -  a keyword reindexing the columuns.

```python
>>> states = ["Texas", "Utah", "California"]
>>> frame. reindex(columns=states)
   Texas  Utah  California
a      1   NaN           2
c      4   NaN           5
d      7   NaN           8
```

**Reindex Function Arguments**


| **Argument** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `labels`	| New sequence to use as an index. Can be Index instance or any other sequence-like Python data structure. An Index will be used exactly as is without any copying. |
| `index` | Use the passed sequence as the new index labels. |
| `columns` | Use the passed sequence as the new column labels. |
| `axis` | The axis to reindex, whether |
| | `index` (rows) or |
| | `columns`. The default is |
| | `index`. You can alternately do |
| | `reindex(index=new_labels)` or |
| | `reindex(columns=new_labels)`. |
| `method` | Interpolation (fill) method; `ffill` fills forward, while `bfill` fills backward. |
| `fill_value` | Substitute value to use when introducing missing data by reindexing. Use `fill_value="missing"` (the default behavior) when you want absent labels to have null values in the result. |
| `limit` | When forward filling or backfilling, the maximum size gap (in number of elements) to fill. |
| `tolerance` | When forward filling or backfilling, the maximum size gap (in absolute numeric distance) to fill for inexact matches. |
| `level` |	Match simple Index on level of MultiIndex; otherwise select subset of. |
| `copy` | If `True`, always copy underlying data even if the new index is equivalent to the old index; if `False`, do not copy the data when the indexes are equivalent. |

It's possible to reindex by using the `loc` operator, and many users prefer to always do it this way. This works only if all of the new index labels already exist in the DataFrame (whereas reindex will insert missing data for new labels):

```python
>>> frame.loc[["a", "d", "c"], ["California", "Texas"]]
   California  Texas
a           2      1
d           8      7
c           5      4
```

## Dropping Entries from an Axis

Dropping one or more entries from an axis is simple if you already have an index array or list without those entries. `reindex` method or `loc` indexing can be used, `drop` method will return a new object with th indicated value or values deleted from an axis

```python
>>> obj = pd.Series(np.arange(5.), index=["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"])
>>> obj
a    0.0
b    1.0
c    2.0
d    3.0
e    4.0
dtype: float64
>>> new_obj = obj.drop("c")
>>> new_obj
a    0.0
b    1.0
d    3.0
e    4.0
dtype: float64
>>> obj.drop(["d","c"])
a    0.0
b    1.0
e    4.0
dtype: float64
```
With DataFrame, index values can be deleted from either axis

The drop labels can be defined by keywords `index`, `columns`, `axis=<number>` (like in NumPy) or `axis="columns`:

```python
>>> data = pd.DataFrame(np.arange(16).reshape((4, 4)),
...     index=["Ohio", "Colorado", "Utah", "New York"],
...     columns=["one", "two", "three", "four"])
>>> data
          one  two  three  four
Ohio        0    1      2     3
Colorado    4    5      6     7
Utah        8    9     10    11
New York   12   13     14    15
>>> data.drop(index=["Colorado","Ohio"])
          one  two  three  four
Utah        8    9     10    11
New York   12   13     14    15
>>> data.drop(columns=["two"])
          one  three  four
Ohio        0      2     3
Colorado    4      6     7
Utah        8     10    11
New York   12     14    15
>>> 
>>> data.drop("two", axis=1)
          one  three  four
Ohio        0      2     3
Colorado    4      6     7
Utah        8     10    11
New York   12     14    15
>>> 
>>> data.drop(["two","four"], axis="columns")
          one  three
Ohio        0      2
Colorado    4      6
Utah        8     10
New York   12     14
```

## Indexing, Selection, and Filtering

Series indexing (obj[...]) works analogously to NumPy array indexing, except you can use the Seriesâ€™s index values instead of only integers. Here are some examples of this:

```python
>>> obj = pd.Series(np.arange(4.), index=["a", "b", "c", "d"])
>>> obj
a    0.0
b    1.0
c    2.0
d    3.0
dtype: float64
>>> 
>>> obj['b']
1.0
>>> obj[1]
1.0
>>> obj[2:4]
c    2.0
d    3.0
dtype: float64
>>> obj[["b","a","d"]]
b    1.0
a    0.0
d    3.0
dtype: float64
>>> obj[[1,3]]
b    1.0
d    3.0
dtype: float64
>>> obj[obj < 2]
a    0.0
b    1.0
dtype: float64
```
`loc` is preferable as it treats integers when indexing with `[ ]`. Regular indexing will treat them in that case as labels if the index contains integers, so the behaviour differs depending on the data type of the index.

```python
>>> obj1 = pd.Series([1, 2, 3], index=[2, 0, 1])
>>> obj2 = pd.Series([1, 2, 3], index=["a", "b", "c"])
>>> 
>>> obj1
2    1
0    2
1    3
dtype: int64
>>> 
>>> obj2
a    1
b    2
c    3
dtype: int64
>>> obj1[[0,1,2]]
0    2
1    3
2    1
dtype: int64
>>> obj2[[0,1,2]]
a    1
b    2
c    3
dtype: int64
>>> 
>>># Using loc will fail if the index does not contain integers
>>> 
>>> obj2.loc[[0,1]]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  ...
  raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the [{axis_name}]")
KeyError: "None of [Int64Index([0, 1], dtype='int64')] are in the [index]"
```

* `loc` operator indexes exclusively with labels
* `iloc` operator indexes exclusively with integers

```python
>>> obj1.iloc[[0,1,2]]
2    1
0    2
1    3
dtype: int64
>>> obj2.iloc[[0,1,2]]
a    1
b    2
c    3
dtype: int64
```

Slicing with labels is possible, but **the endpoint is inclusive!**

```python
>>> obj2.loc["b":"c"]
b    2
c    3
dtype: int64
```

Values can be asigned to a slice - again, ingluding the endpoint

```python
>>> obj2.loc["b":"c"] = 5
>>> obj2
a    1
b    5
c    5
dtype: int64
```

**Indexing into a DataFrame**

Indexing into a DataFrame retrieves one or more columns either with a single value or sequence.

```python
>>> data = pd.DataFrame(np.arange(16).reshape((4, 4)),
...     index=["Ohio", "Colorado", "Utah", "New York"],
...     columns=["one", "two", "three", "four"])
>>> data
          one  two  three  four
Ohio        0    1      2     3
Colorado    4    5      6     7
Utah        8    9     10    11
New York   12   13     14    15

>>> data["two"]
Ohio         1
Colorado     5
Utah         9
New York    13
Name: two, dtype: int64
>>> data[["three","one"]]
          three  one
Ohio          2    0
Colorado      6    4
Utah         10    8
New York     14   12

```

**Special cases of indexing**

1. Slicing or selecting data with Boolean array

```python
>>> data[:2]
          one  two  three  four
Ohio        0    1      2     3
Colorado    4    5      6     7

>>> data[data["three"] > 5]
          one  two  three  four
Colorado    4    5      6     7
Utah        8    9     10    11
New York   12   13     14    15
```
The row selection syntax `data[:2]` is provided as a convenience. Passing a single element or a list to the `[]` operator selects columns.

2. Indexing with a Boolean DataFrame, such as one produced by a scalar comparison

```python
>>> data < 5
            one    two  three   four
Ohio       True   True   True   True
Colorado   True  False  False  False
Utah      False  False  False  False
New York  False  False  False  False
```

Possible to use this DataFrame to assign the value 0 to each location with the value `True`

```python
>>> data[data < 5] = 0
>>> data
          one  two  three  four
Ohio        0    0      0     0
Colorado    0    5      6     7
Utah        8    9     10    11
New York   12   13     14    15
```

**Selection on DataFrame with loc and iloc**

Like Series, DataFrame has special attributes `loc` and `iloc` for label-based and integer-based indexing, respectively. Since DataFrame is two-dimensional, you can select a subset of the rows and columns with NumPy-like notation using either axis labels (loc) or integers (iloc).

* Select a single row by label:

```python
>>> data.loc["Colorado"]
one      0
two      5
three    6
four     7
Name: Colorado, dtype: int64
```

Result of selecting a single row is a Series with index that contains the DataFrame's column lables.

* Pass a sequence of labels to select multiple roles:

```python
>>> data.loc[["Colorado","New York"]]
          one  two  three  four
Colorado    0    5      6     7
New York   12   13     14    15
```

* Combine row and column selection in `loc` by separating the selections with `,`:

```python
>>> data.loc["Colorado",["two","three"]]
two      5
three    6
Name: Colorado, dtype: int64
```

* Perform with integers, using `iloc`, integers select indexes from axis 0:

```python
# single iloc index
>>> data.iloc[2]
one       8
two       9
three    10
four     11
Name: Utah, dtype: int64

# two integers
>>> data.iloc[[2,1]]
          one  two  three  four
Utah        8    9     10    11
Colorado    0    5      6     7

# comma separated lists of indexes [[axis 0],[axis 1]]
>>> data.iloc[2, [3, 0, 1]]
four    11
one      8
two      9
Name: Utah, dtype: int64
>>> data.iloc[[1, 2], [3, 0, 1]]
          four  one  two
Colorado     7    0    5
Utah        11    8    9
```

* `loc` & `iloc` work with slices as well:

```python
>>> data
          one  two  three  four
Ohio        0    0      0     0
Colorado    0    5      6     7
Utah        8    9     10    11
New York   12   13     14    15
>>> 
>>> 
>>> data.loc[:"Utah", "two"]
Ohio        0
Colorado    5
Utah        9
Name: two, dtype: int64
>>> 
>>> data.iloc[:,:3]
          one  two  three
Ohio        0    0      0
Colorado    0    5      6
Utah        8    9     10
New York   12   13     14
>>> 
>>> data.iloc[:,:3][data.three > 5]
          one  two  three
Colorado    0    5      6
Utah        8    9     10
New York   12   13     14
```

* Boolean arrays can be used with `loc` but not `iloc`:

```python
>>> data.loc[data.three >= 2]
          one  two  three  four
Colorado    0    5      6     7
Utah        8    9     10    11
New York   12   13     14    15
```

There are many ways to select and rearrange the data in pandas object.

**Indexing Options with DataFrame**

| **Type** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- |
| `df[column]` | Select single column or sequence of columns from the DataFrame; special case conveniences: Boolean array (filter rows), slice (slice rows), or Boolean DataFrame (set values based on some criterion) |
| `df.loc[rows]` | Select single row or subset of rows from the DataFrame by label |
| `df.loc[:, cols]` | Select single column or subset of columns by label |
| `df.loc[rows, cols]` | Select both row(s) and column(s) by label |
| `df.iloc[rows]` | Select single row or subset of rows from the DataFrame by integer position |
| `df.iloc[:, cols]` | Select single column or subset of columns by integer position |
| `df.iloc[rows, cols]` | Select both row(s) and column(s) by integer position |
| `df.at[row, col]`	| Select a single scalar value by row and column label |
| `df.iat[row, col]` | Select a single scalar value by row and column position (integers) |
| `reindex` method | Select either rows or columns by labels |

**Integer Indexing Pitfalls**

In pandas, objects indexed with integers work differently from built-in Python data structures like lists and tuples. For example, see this error:

```python
>>> ser = pd.Series(np.arange(3.))
>>> ser
0    0.0
1    1.0
2    2.0
dtype: float64
>>> ser[-1]
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
    return self._range.index(new_key)
ValueError: -1 is not in range

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

Traceback (most recent call last):
...
    raise KeyError(key) from err
KeyError: -1
```

DataFrame `ser` has an index containing 0, 1, and 2, but pandas does not want to guess what the user wants (label-based indexing or position-based):

* With a noninteger index, there is no such ambiguity:

```python
>>> ser2 = pd.Series(np.arange(3.), index=["a", "b", "c"])
>>> ser2
a    0.0
b    1.0
c    2.0
dtype: float64
>>> 
>>> ser2[-1]
2.0
```

* Slicing ith integers is always integer oriented:

```python
>>> ser2[:2]
a    0.0
b    1.0
dtype: float64
```

Therefore it's preferable to always indexing with `loc` and `iloc` to avoid this ambiguity.

**Pitfalls with Chained Indexing**

The indexing attributes `loc` & `iloc` can be used to modify DataFrame objects in place, but doing so requires some care.

* Assigning to a column or row by label or integer position, using the example DataFrame above:

```python
>>> data.loc[:,"one"] = 1
>>> data
          one  two  three  four
Ohio        1    0      0     0
Colorado    1    5      6     7
Utah        1    9     10    11
New York    1   13     14    15
>>> 
>>> data.iloc[2] = 5
>>> data
          one  two  three  four
Ohio        1    0      0     0
Colorado    1    5      6     7
Utah        5    5      5     5
New York    1   13     14    15
>>> 
>>> data.loc[data["four"] > 5] = 3
>>> data
          one  two  three  four
Ohio        1    0      0     0
Colorado    3    3      3     3
Utah        5    5      5     5
New York    3    3      3     3

```

* Another possibility with a single `loc` assignment:

```python
>>> data.loc[data.three == 5, "three"] = 6
>>> data
          one  two  three  four
Ohio        1    0      0     0
Colorado    3    3      3     3
Utah        5    5      6     5
New York    3    3      3     3
```
A good rule of thumb is to avoid chained indexing when doing assignments. Aways good to check more in pandas documentation.
